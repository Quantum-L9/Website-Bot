 * and this handler re-auths and re-hydrates process.env without restarting.
 *
 * Returns an uninstall function that removes the listener when called.

 *
 * Keep intervalMs shorter than the Infisical rotation overlap window to
 * guarantee every instance re-fetches before the old credential is revoked.
